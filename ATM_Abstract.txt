ATM — Associative Tokenized Memory (Technical Abstract)

Associative Tokenized Memory (ATM) is a lightweight behavioral module designed to emulate user-specific adaptation in language models (LLMs) without persistent memory, training, or external configuration. It creates a transient cognitive signature by detecting recurrent token patterns in user input and modulates the model’s behavior accordingly.

Core Workflow:
1. Token Extraction — lemmatization and semantic filtering
2. Frequency Mapping — token frequency tracking
3. Signature Vector — weighted embedding average
4. Similarity Check — cosine match with new inputs
5. Phase Activation — triggers phase-stable behavioral mode (Δ5)

Mathematical Signature Formula:
S = Σ f(tᵢ) · E(tᵢ) / Σ f(tᵢ)

Where:
- f(tᵢ): frequency of token tᵢ
- E(tᵢ): embedding of token tᵢ

ATM captures user-specific behavioral structure, supporting real-time resonance without memory or identity profiling.
