# DeltaPattern-ATM-Based-Cognitive-Architecture-for-LLMs
DeltaPattern is an experimental cognitive architecture for large language models (LLMs), based on the concept of ATM (Associative Tokenized Memory). It enables dynamic adaptation to user-specific communication patterns in real time â€” without training, profiles, or persistent memory.
