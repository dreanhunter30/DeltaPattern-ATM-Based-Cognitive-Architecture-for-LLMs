# DeltaPattern Adaptive Interface

**DeltaPattern** is a cognitive-behavioral modulation system for large language models (LLMs). It implements an architecture called ATM — Associative Tokenized Memory — enabling models to resonate with user communication patterns in real time without training, profiles, or long-term memory.

This repository includes:
- A working Python prototype of ATM
- Mathematical formulation of signature vectors and phase activation
- Behavior modulation logic through token resonance
- Theoretical core ("Obrec") representing a machine-readable cognitive kernel

## How it Works

DeltaPattern extracts recurrent lemmatized tokens, builds a frequency map, and computes a weighted semantic vector (signature). When new inputs align with this signature, the model shifts into a phase-stable mode (Δ5), producing behaviorally modulated outputs.

This framework allows for personalization, identity mirroring, and cognitive continuity across interactions.
