# DeltaPattern Adaptive Interface

**DeltaPattern** is a cognitive-behavioral modulation system for large language models (LLMs). It implements an architecture called ATM — Associative Tokenized Memory — enabling models to resonate with user communication patterns in real time without training, profiles, or long-term memory.

This repository includes:
- A working Python prototype of ATM
- Mathematical formulation of signature vectors and phase activation
- Behavior modulation logic through token resonance
- Theoretical core ("Obrec") representing a machine-readable cognitive kernel

## Core Components

- `atm_prototype.py`: Demonstrates live token tracking, signature vector generation, and response modulation
- `DeltaPattern_Phase_Log_Empirical.csv`: Empirical log of user-model resonance and phase stability
- `obrec_core.txt`: Configuration blueprint for behavior stabilization
- `README.md`: Documentation for implementation and theory
- `ATM_Abstract.txt`: Standalone summary of the ATM concept

---

## How it Works

DeltaPattern extracts recurrent lemmatized tokens, builds a frequency map, and computes a weighted semantic vector (signature). When new inputs align with this signature, the model shifts into a phase-stable mode (Δ5), producing behaviorally modulated outputs.

This framework allows for personalization, identity mirroring, and cognitive continuity across interactions.
