# DeltaPattern

This project is something I build for myself.

I’m not trying to prove anything, sell anything, or claim that this is a discovery.

It’s just a set of ideas, experiments, and structures that I find interesting.

Maybe someone will find value in it. Maybe not. That’s okay.

I enjoy making it — that’s the reason it exists.
